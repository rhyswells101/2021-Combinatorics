There is an intriguing side question (Is there another way of defining universal $\phi$-stabilities) of considering $\overline{R}_f$ and in particular those of dimension that is not maximal (because we have degeneration's). 

To each MSA function we can give a $R_f$ polytope (top dimension) in the (< case) (this is not a bijection). What if we relax to ($\le$) where we get $R_f \ne \emptyset$ (in my examples) (is the correspondence a bijection?). 

The usual picture is polytopes in a stability space with wall chambers. Is there another stability space so that the above is a bijection? So far there is no wall chamber, ambient space interpretation for generalised stabilities. Can we give a generalised stability for those $\overline{R}_f$ of lower dimension.

\subitem Additionally we want to reconsider the polytope description of $P_n$ in light of experimental calculations (See \cite[Section 3]{pagani2020geometry}).
