Avoid discussions of the universal generalised stability and the need for compatibility where $\Gamma \in G_{g,n}$ we will have constraints as has to reduce to every graph. Must be compatible with contractions. 


Universal generalised stability condition. for a stable graph take its isomorphism class $\Gamma \in G_{g,n}$ what is a contraction of graphs see \cite[Section 2.2]{kass2019stability}. 

Why are MSA functions in bijection with universal generalised stability notions?; see \cite[Theorem 6.4]{pagani2020geometry} and the preceding discussion.

After introducing universal compatibility conditions for generalised stability conditions $\sigma(G)$ for a single curve in $g=1$, we wish to consider example calculations and compare these to compatible $\phi$-polarised universal conditions.

In $g=1$ the axioms of generalised stabilities are easier to manage see \cite[Definition 6.5]{pagani2020geometry} for notation on this case and compatibility's to the universal case.
