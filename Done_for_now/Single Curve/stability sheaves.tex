It is well known for a smooth curve there is one type of stability on line bundles, stability of line bundles on smooth curves is uninteresting , stability for rank 1 torsion is only combinatorial and decided by the muiltidegree. Because wer working with rank 1 on a nodal curves thats why wer interested in divisors on graphs.
