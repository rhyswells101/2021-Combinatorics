How we are using the tropical paper in the emails. 

The jacobian of a dual graph discussion takes places in the tropical world, where $J(G)$ acts on the strata of the tropical Jacobian. The group action is free and transitive on $0$-strata (which are generic points of the fine compactified jacoiban).

There is a finite abelian relative group scheme (stack).

$$J^{discrete}_{g,n} \rightarrow \overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$$

Over each $(C,p_1,\dots,p_n)$ is $J_{\Gamma_{C}}$ and $J^{discrete}_{g,n}$ acts on the set of irreducible components of each fine compactified universal jacobian.

% The construction of compactified universal Jacoibans over $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ by [Mel16] which builds on the work of [Est01] as noted in \cite{pagani2020geometry}. 

For a discussion on $\phi$-stability and the stability space $V_{g,n}$ see \cite[Section 5]{kass2019stability}. There for a given curve/graph $\Gamma$ we note for an $\phi \in V^{d}(\Gamma)$ we can assoicate a universal condition that is compatible $\forall \Gamma \in G_{g,n}$, i.e. $\phi \in V^{d}_{g,n}$ to which we can associate a fine $\phi$-compactified universal Jacobian. $\overline{J}_{g,n}(\phi)$ to which an element is of the for $(C,p_1\dots,p_n,\mathcal{F})$ where $\mathcal{F}$ is a $\phi$-stable rank 1 torsion free sheaf.
