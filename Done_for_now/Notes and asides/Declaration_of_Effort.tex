\section{General feelings over  the past  year}

% I am worried that when "covid is over" I will be expected to snap back to where I should have been and to be able to produce better quality work.

% Additionally for the past few months I feel I have been going through the motions of work but not really feeling like I have achieved anything. 

% More of my time and energy has been spent on maintaining a positive attitude and to doing strictly 9-5 hours. My logic being that if I treat this as a standard job and put in consistent effort things will turn out okay, and whatever I produce will be good enough. I honestly feel that without this toning back I would have burnt out and quit.

% This is not what I imagined to be doing but it is the reality I am facing to stay with this program. I have and will try my best, and I will not feel guilty for lack of progress I have made.
