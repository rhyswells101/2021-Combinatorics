% The objects of study are fine compactified Jacobians and universal fine compactified Jacobians.\\

% For a curve $X$ a fine compactified Jacobian is a connected open subscheme of larger stack that is proper. Elements of a fine compactified Jacobian $\overline{J}(X)$, are determined by the set of degenerate nodes and the multidegree of the degenerate sheaves. 


% Fine compactified universal jacoibians are open and proper of some stack. Fine compactifeid Jacobians are fibers of a fine comapctifeid universal Jacobian. 

% One can study the decompositions of fine compactified Jacobians as fibers over the topological stratification of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$.

% We will work at two different levels, the universal case and the curve specific case \cite[Definition 2.3]{pagani2020geometry}.
