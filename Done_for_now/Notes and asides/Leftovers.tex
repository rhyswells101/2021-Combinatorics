Consider abstraction of the problem to combinatorial Species, with the bijection, 

$\tilde{p}:FinSet : FinSet $
 with $A \mapsto \tilde{p}_A$ which related to $\sum^{\infty}_{n=0} |\tilde{P}_n| x^n$. where we want coefficients. We build up species by generating functions.

\item How does one pullback from the universal case $\tilde{P}_n$ to the single curve case $Q_n$. See the schematic in Samsung meeting notes.
